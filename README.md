AI-Powered Candidate Screening Workflow using LangGraph & Gemini ⚡🤖

This project demonstrates an intelligent candidate-screening workflow built using LangGraph, 
LangChain, and Google Gemini 2.0 Flash. It automatically analyzes job applications, 
determines the candidate’s experience level, checks if their skills match the job requirements,
and routes them to the correct outcome—shortlisting, escalation, or rejection. 
The system uses a structured state-based graph, ensuring clear, transparent decision-making
and easy extensibility for real-world HR automation.

The workflow processes the application in two major phases: first by categorizing the candidate
as entry-level, mid-level, or senior-level, and then by checking if the applicant’s skills 
align with what a Python developer role requires. Based on these evaluations,
the system intelligently chooses the next action using conditional routing.
This makes the entire screening flow consistent, explainable, and suitable for integration 
into larger hiring pipelines.
